## Formerly _mksh_

As the name _mksh_ is more commonly associated with the
[MirBSD Korn Shell](https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm), this repo has been renamed
from _mksh_ to _mkx_. The same goes for the namesake script within.

Invoking `mksh` with `mkx` used to be the equivalent of `mksh -b` or
`mksh -i <interpreter>`. But the with this name change, `mkx` was now made to
work like `mksh`.

## Tests

Tests are written in [Bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
